# Program needs to be stored in memory. Initially program will be saved in RAM.

# When PC turned off, RAM contents about the program will be lost.

# Bits - 0's and 1's

# Byte - 8 bits. Each byte have memory address to access from the computer memory

# Word - 16 bits.

# Long - 32 bits.

# Variable - name of the variable. Values can be changed.

# Constants - Data do not change and retain their value through the program.

# Naming Variables Rules: (Valid names)
    1. Jason
    2. myFlag
    3. i
    4. my_variable
    5. _variable
    6. J5x7

# Naming Variables Rules: (invalid names) - Compiler throws the error
    1. temp$value - $ is not a valid character in variable names
    2. my flag - embedded spaces are not permitted
    3. 3jason - Variable can't start with a number
    4. int, float, char, bool - reserved words

# Data Types
    1. int - integer ()
    2. float - floating point
    3. char - character
    4. bool - boolean
    5. string - string
    6. double - double

# Variables and its datatype needs to declared before use.

# Assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable.

# Initialization of variables
    1. Example: int a = 10 - declaring a variable and Initialization its values as 10
