# Starts with POUND symbol (#) followed by the INCLUDE

# Ex: #include <stdio.h>

# It is not strictly part of the executable code, but code won't work without it

# An instruction to compiler to do something before compiling the source code

# Telling the compiler to include the file named with <stdio.h>

# For example to use printf statement, stdio.h file needs to be imported to the code

# stdio, is short for standard input/output library

# Header files used to integrate any predefined functions within a program

# We can create own header files using C program

# Basically as software reuse functionality

# Header files are Case-Sensitive. So, always use lowercase to include preprocessor

# Two ways to include header files

# 1. #include <stdio.h> - look for stdio.h file in one or more standard system directory

# 2. #include "header.h" - look for header.h file in current directory. User defined header files

# To avoid multiple inclusion of a header file, use #define, #ifndef, and #endif

# Simply called as guarding against the multiple inclusion of header

# #include - include a header file

# #define - define a constant

# #ifdef - if defined

# #ifndef - if not defined

# #endif - end of ifndef

# #else - else

# Header files also includes many different things like #define, structure declaration, typedef statements, function prototypes

# Header files don't contain any logic only DEFINITIONS. Just tells that, this function exists, that structure exists, etc.,

# Header files won't explain what this function is doing
