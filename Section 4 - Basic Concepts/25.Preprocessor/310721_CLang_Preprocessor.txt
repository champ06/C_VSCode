# Unique feature of the C Language

# Allows programs to be easier to develop, read, modify and port to different computer or OS

# It is part of C Compilation process. It executes before the actual C program (Source Code) execution. That's why it is called as preprocesor

# It starts with the POUND sign (#) without any space or special characters

# It is used to define a preprocessor directive

# We can create own constants, MACROS using the #define statement

# Other powerful conditional statements like #ifdef, #endif, #else, and #ifndef
