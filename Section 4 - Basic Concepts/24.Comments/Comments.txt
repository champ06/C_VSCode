# Comments are used to document a program to enhance its readability and understanding

# To remind you and someone who is looking at the code that the this piece of code or entire program is doing some activities

# Comments are ignored by the compiler

# It saves lot of time, because if I'm looking at the code after 6 months, I just need to read the comments for understanding the code

# 2 Ways for commenting in C Language

# Multi-line comments & Single-line comments

# Multi-line comments are used to comment out a block of code using (/* ... */)

# Single-line comments are used to comment out a single line of code using (// Single line comment)

# Style of comments

*/

# Style 2:
/***************************************
* Written by Rakuram     *
* reach me through github chat or email    *

# Commenting at the end of line of code is also allowed

# Using easily recogniable variable names represents the good quality of code
